'''
game to ask basic math questions
base component
v1 - set up the skeleton of the program
v2 - calling functions (tested, and it works)
v3 - adding in length & width functions (the functions are being called in the different shapes functions)
v4 - calculating the area and perimeter of each shape (I also replaced the length and width function with int_checker)
