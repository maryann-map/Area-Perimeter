game to ask basic math questions
base component
v1 - set up the skeleton of the program
v2 - calling functions (tested, and it works)
v3 - adding in length & width functions (the functions are being called in the different shapes functions)
v4 - calculating the area and perimeter of each shape (I also replaced the length and width function with int_checker)
v5 - adding in string_checker & get_shape functions (include valid_shapes list)
   - also added in a 5th shape (parallelogram)
v6 - ask user what answer they got & compare with programmes answer (code in each shape function)
v7 - summary of chosen shapes and their answers displayed in a table format
v8 - introduction
v9 - outro
v10 - tidying up
